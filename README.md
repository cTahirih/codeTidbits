# CodeTidbits

Last year was the first time I participated in Hacktoberfest, I made more than five contributions and I was very happy.
This year I not only want to contribute, so I created this repository with something basic to grow and be a super project.

Use this project to make your first contribution to an open source project on GitHub. Practice making your first pull request to a public repository before doing the real thing!

Celebrate [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) by getting involved in the open source community by completing some simple tasks in this project.

This repository is open to all members of the GitHub community. Any member may contribute to this project without being a collaborator.

## What is Hacktoberfest?
A month-long celebration from October sponsored by [Digital Ocean](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/) and GitHub to get people involved in [Open Source](https://github.com/open-source). Create your very first pull request to any public repository on GitHub and contribute to the open source developer community.
